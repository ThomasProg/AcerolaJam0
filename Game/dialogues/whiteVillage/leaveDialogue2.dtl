The source of the [outline_size=3][outline_color=purple][wave amp=20 freq=5]aberrations[/wave][/outline_color][/outline_size] is said to be close to the [color=dark_blue]Blue[/color] village, in the east.
The [color=dark_red]Red[/color] village, located above, has a power that can make your stronger.
The [color=dark_green]Green[/color] village, located below, has a power that can make you more resistant.
The [color=dark_blue]Blue[/color] village had something too, but... I don't know if it's still the case.
Good luck on your adventure.
