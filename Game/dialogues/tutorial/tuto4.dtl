Oh no...
It's.. an [outline_size=3][outline_color=purple][wave amp=20 freq=5]aberration[/wave][/outline_color][/outline_size].
No one knows what it is, but it recently started to spread, like an infection.
It's slowly destroying this world.
That's why we call it an "[outline_size=3][outline_color=purple][wave amp=20 freq=5]aberration[/wave][/outline_color][/outline_size]". It shouldn't belong to this world.
Try to destroy it by attacking it with left click.
