Hey! Wake up!
What difficulty do you want?
- Normal [if true == true]
	do SaveManager.setDifficulty(0.0)
- Hard [if true == true]
	do SaveManager.setDifficulty(1.0)
- Impossible [if true == true]
	do SaveManager.setDifficulty(2.0)
You can always change it by pressing escape anyways!
Also, did you sleep too much you forgot how to move?
Everyone knows you just use [b]a[/b] and [b]d[/b] or the [b]arrows[/b]!
Try to catch me if you can!
